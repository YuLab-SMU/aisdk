\usage{
execute_tool_calls(
  tool_calls,
  tools,
  hooks = NULL,
  envir = NULL,
  repair_enabled = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tool_calls}{A list of tool call objects, each with id, name, and arguments.}

\item{tools}{A list of Tool objects to search for matching tools.}

\item{hooks}{Optional HookHandler object.}

\item{envir}{Optional environment in which to execute tools. When provided,
tool functions can access and modify variables in this environment,
enabling cross-agent data sharing through a shared session environment.}

\item{repair_enabled}{Whether to attempt tool call repair (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A list of execution results, each containing:
\itemize{
\item id: The tool call ID
\item name: The tool name
\item result: The execution result (or error message)
\item is_error: TRUE if an error occurred during execution
}
}
\description{
Execute a list of tool calls returned by an LLM. This function safely
executes each tool, handling errors gracefully and returning a standardized
result format.

Implements multi-layer defense strategy:
\enumerate{
\item Tool name repair (case fixing, snake_case conversion, fuzzy matching)
\item Invalid tool routing for graceful degradation
\item Argument parsing with JSON repair
\item Error capture and structured error responses
}
}
